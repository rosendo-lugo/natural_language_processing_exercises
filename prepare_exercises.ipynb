arbeenas older sister was five when they made the move to the us arbeena was born later becoming the first in her family to be a us citizen at codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously after speaking with arbeena we were taught that the term aapi excludes desiamerican individuals hence we will now use the term asian pacific islander desi american apida here is how the rest of our conversation with arbeena went how do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions i celebrate nepals version of christmas or dashain this is a nineday celebration also known as dussehra i grew up as hindu and i identify as hindu this is a very large part of my heritage  other ways i connect with my culture include sharing food momos are south asian dumplings and theyre my favorite to make and share on my asian american side i am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within apida social or political movements i participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because i come from a mixedstatus family ive always been in a community with undocumented asian immigrants  what are some of the challenges you have faced as an apida individual personally or professionally i often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover professionally i am often stereotyped as meek so ive been overlooked for leadership roles we are seen as perpetually foreign people tend to other us in that way yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like this has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me  can you describe some common barriers of entry that apida individuals specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace being overlooked for leadership in the past i have not been viewed as a leader people sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of asian women not being able to be bold or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional  how do you believe microaggressions impact apida individuals in the workplace can you provide examples of such microaggressions erasure is big to me only saying merry christmas isnt inclusive to other religions people are often resistant to saying happy holidays but saying merry christmas excludes and does not appreciate my heritage  often microaggressions are not micro at all they typically are not aggressive racialized violence but the term micro minimizes impact some that ive heard are what kind of asian are you or where are you from this automatically makes me the other and not seen as american even within the apida community south asians are overlooked as asian how important is representation specifically apida representation in organizational leadership positions i want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles and it is but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you certain privileges such as wealth resources or lack of interaction with lowersocioeconomicstatus asian americans may cause a difference in community politics i do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment how do you feel about codeswitching and have you ever felt it necessary to codeswitch i like sharing south asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture a workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us however having to codeswitch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures  finally in your opinion what longterm strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support equality and inclusion for apida individuals prior to a career in financial aid i did a lot of research related to the post911 immigration of the south asian diaspora this background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing hire the people that want to innovate hire the changemakers hire the buttonpushers reduce reliance on whiteness as change this will become natural for the organization and become organizational change change comes from us on the ground a huge thank you to arbeena thapa for sharing her experiences and being vulnerable with us your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable we hope we can become better support for the apida community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth'"

We are seen a perpetually foreign; people tend to other u in that way, yet put u on a pedestal for what a model minority look like. This ha made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumption get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barrier of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically woman may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed a a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotype of Asian woman not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individual in the workplace? Can you provide example of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and doe not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically make me the ‘other’ and not seen a American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked a “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who look like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leader may not share the same belief a you. Certain privilege such a wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for play a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian term or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and make space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategy can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness a change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change come from u on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your word were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more ha been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community a we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.'"

This month we celebrate the history and contribution made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunity to better understand the AAPI community. In an effort to address real concern and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies a Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parent immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister wa five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena wa born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our effort at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known a Dussehra. I grew up a Hindu and I identify a Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other way I connect with my culture include sharing food!

In the past, I have not been viewed a a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotype of Asian woman not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individual in the workplace?

       "      <td>May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.</td>\n",

       "0  May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us.

In my time here across multiple different roles and departments, I’ve seen a lot of change. The consistent things have always been the high quality of passionate and hardworking people I get to work with; the impactful mission we get to work on; and the inspiring students who trust us with their career change.” Don’t forget to tune in on March 29th to sit in on an insightful conversation.  \n",

To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry! Meet Madeleine! Madeleine Capper is a Data Scientist in San Antonio, Texas. A long-standing San Antonio resident, she studied mathematics at the University of Texas San Antonio and has worked as a Data Scientist for Booz Allen Hamilton. Madeleine currently teaches Data Science at Codeup, where she works daily with burgeoning data professionals to help them actualize their career aspirations through technical education. Madeleine attended Codeup as a student in early 2019 as a pupil in the very first Codeup Data Science cohort. The program proved immediately effective and she was the first student to obtain a data career out of the program.

       "      <td>May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.</td>\n",

       "0  May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us.

In my time here across multiple different roles and departments, I’ve seen a lot of change. The consistent things have always been the high quality of passionate and hardworking people I get to work with; the impactful mission we get to work on; and the inspiring students who trust us with their career change.” Don’t forget to tune in on March 29th to sit in on an insightful conversation.  \n",

To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry! Meet Madeleine! Madeleine Capper is a Data Scientist in San Antonio, Texas. A long-standing San Antonio resident, she studied mathematics at the University of Texas San Antonio and has worked as a Data Scientist for Booz Allen Hamilton. Madeleine currently teaches Data Science at Codeup, where she works daily with burgeoning data professionals to help them actualize their career aspirations through technical education. Madeleine attended Codeup as a student in early 2019 as a pupil in the very first Codeup Data Science cohort. The program proved immediately effective and she was the first student to obtain a data career out of the program. After working at Booz Allen Hamilton, Madeleine’s passion for education in conjunction with her appreciation for Codeup’s capacity for transformative life change brought her back to the institution in an instructional capacity, where she has been teaching for two years.

       "      <td>Spotlight on APIDA Voices: Celebrating Heritage and Inspiring Change ft. Arbeena Thapa</td>\n",
       "      <td>May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.</td>\n",

       "0  May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.   \n",

To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry!  Meet Magdalena! Magdalena Rahn is a current Codeup student in a Data Science cohort in San Antonio, Texas. She has a professional background in cross-cultural communications, international business development, the wine industry and journalism. After serving in the US Navy, she decided to complement her professional skill set by attending the Data Science program at Codeup; she is set to graduate in March 2023.

To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry! Meet Madeleine! Madeleine Capper is a Data Scientist in San Antonio, Texas. A long-standing San Antonio resident, she studied mathematics at the University of Texas San Antonio and has worked as a Data Scientist for Booz Allen Hamilton. Madeleine currently teaches Data Science at Codeup, where she works daily with burgeoning data professionals to help them actualize their career aspirations through technical education. Madeleine attended Codeup as a student in early 2019 as a pupil in the very first Codeup Data Science cohort. The program proved immediately effective and she was the first student to obtain a data career out of the program. After working at Booz Allen Hamilton, Madeleine’s passion for education in conjunction with her appreciation for Codeup’s capacity for transformative life change brought her back to the institution in an instructional capacity, where she has been teaching for two years.

       "      <td>May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.</td>\n",

       "0  May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us.

In my time here across multiple different roles and departments, I’ve seen a lot of change. The consistent things have always been the high quality of passionate and hardworking people I get to work with; the impactful mission we get to work on; and the inspiring students who trust us with their career change.” Don’t forget to tune in on March 29th to sit in on an insightful conversation.   \n",

To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry! Meet Madeleine! Madeleine Capper is a Data Scientist in San Antonio, Texas. A long-standing San Antonio resident, she studied mathematics at the University of Texas San Antonio and has worked as a Data Scientist for Booz Allen Hamilton. Madeleine currently teaches Data Science at Codeup, where she works daily with burgeoning data professionals to help them actualize their career aspirations through technical education. Madeleine attended Codeup as a student in early 2019 as a pupil in the very first Codeup Data Science cohort. The program proved immediately effective and she was the first student to obtain a data career out of the program.

       "      <td>Spotlight on APIDA Voices: Celebrating Heritage and Inspiring Change ft. Arbeena Thapa</td>\n",
       "      <td>May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us. Your words were inspiring and the opportunity to understand your perspective more has been valuable. We hope we can become better support for the APIDA community as we learn and grow on our journey of cultivating inclusive growth.</td>\n",

       "0  May is traditionally known as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. This month we celebrate the history and contributions made possible by our AAPI friends, family, and community. We also examine our level of support and seek opportunities to better understand the AAPI community.  In an effort to address real concerns and experiences, we sat down with Arbeena Thapa, one of Codeup’s Financial Aid and Enrollment Managers. Arbeena identifies as Nepali American and Desi. Arbeena’s parents immigrated to Texas in 1988 for better employment and educational opportunities. Arbeena’s older sister was five when they made the move to the US. Arbeena was born later, becoming the first in her family to be a US citizen. At Codeup we take our efforts at inclusivity very seriously. After speaking with Arbeena, we were taught that the term AAPI excludes Desi-American individuals. Hence, we will now use the term Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA). Here is how the rest of our conversation with Arbeena went! How do you celebrate or connect with your heritage and cultural traditions? “I celebrate Nepal’s version of Christmas or Dashain. This is a nine-day celebration also known as Dussehra. I grew up as Hindu and I identify as Hindu, this is a very large part of my heritage. “ “Other ways I connect with my culture include sharing food! Momos are South Asian Dumplings and they’re my favorite to make and share.” “On my Asian American side, I am an advocate of immigrant justice and erasure within APIDA social or political movements. I participate in events to embrace my identity such as immigrant justice advocacy because I come from a mixed-status family. I’ve always been in a community with undocumented Asian immigrants. .” What are some of the challenges you have faced as an APIDA individual, personally or professionally? “I often struggle with being gendered as compliant or a pushover. Professionally, I am often stereotyped as meek, so I’ve been overlooked for leadership roles. We are seen as perpetually foreign; people tend to other us in that way, yet put us on a pedestal for what a model minority looks like. This has made me hesitant to share my heritage in the past because these assumptions get mapped onto me. ” Can you describe some common barriers of entry that APIDA individuals, specifically women may face when trying to enter or advance in the workplace? “Being overlooked for leadership. In the past, I have not been viewed as a leader. People sometimes have preconceived stereotypes of Asian women not being able to be bold, or being vocal can be mistaken for being too emotional. “ How do you believe microaggressions impact APIDA individuals in the workplace? Can you provide examples of such microaggressions? “Erasure is big. To me, only saying ‘Merry Christmas’ isn’t inclusive to other religions. People are often resistant to saying ‘Happy Holidays,’ but saying Merry Christmas excludes, and does not appreciate my heritage. “ “Often microaggressions are not micro at all. They typically are not aggressive racialized violence, but the term ‘micro’ minimizes impact.” “Some that I’ve heard are ‘What kind of Asian are you?’ or ‘Where are you from?’ This automatically makes me the ‘other’ and not seen as American. Even within the APIDA community, South Asians are overlooked as “Asian”.” How important is representation, specifically APIDA representation, in organizational leadership positions? “I want to say that it is important to have someone who looks like you in leadership roles, and it is, but those leaders may not share the same beliefs as you. Certain privileges such as wealth, resources, or lack of interaction with lower-socioeconomic-status Asian Americans may cause a difference in community politics. I do not think the bamboo ceiling is acceptable, but the company you work for plays a big part in your politics and belief alignment.” How do you feel about code-switching, and have you ever felt it necessary to code-switch? “I like sharing South Asian terms or connecting with others that have similar heritage and culture. A workplace that is welcoming to going into this sort of breakout is refreshing and makes space for us. However, having to code-switch could also mean a workplace that is not conducive and welcoming of other cultures. “ Finally, in your opinion, what long-term strategies can create lasting change in the workplace and ensure support, equality, and inclusion for APIDA individuals? “Prior to a career in financial aid, I did a lot of research related to the post-9/11 immigration of the South Asian diaspora. This background made me heavily rely on grassroots organizing. Hire the people that want to innovate, hire the changemakers, hire the button-pushers. Reduce reliance on whiteness as change. This will become natural for the organization and become organizational change. Change comes from us on the ground.” A huge thank you to Arbeena Thapa for sharing her experiences, and being vulnerable with us.

In my time here across multiple different roles and departments, I’ve seen a lot of change. The consistent things have always been the high quality of passionate and hardworking people I get to work with; the impactful mission we get to work on; and the inspiring students who trust us with their career change.” Don’t forget to tune in on March 29th to sit in on an insightful conversation.   \n",

To further celebrate, we’d like to spotlight each of our panelists leading up to the discussion to learn a bit about their respective experiences as women in the tech industry! Meet Madeleine! Madeleine Capper is a Data Scientist in San Antonio, Texas. A long-standing San Antonio resident, she studied mathematics at the University of Texas San Antonio and has worked as a Data Scientist for Booz Allen Hamilton. Madeleine currently teaches Data Science at Codeup, where she works daily with burgeoning data professionals to help them actualize their career aspirations through technical education. Madeleine attended Codeup as a student in early 2019 as a pupil in the very first Codeup Data Science cohort. The program proved immediately effective and she was the first student to obtain a data career out of the program.
